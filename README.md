# Challenge18

The files in this repository include:  
1)  a Visualizations folder containing all images referenced in the 'Module 18 Challenge.pdf' analysis write up
2) a Jupyter Source File called 'merge' that shows all work done on transforming and reducing the imported data to a managable size
3) 'sample_filtered.csv' which is the sample data file to import into Tableau Public
4) 'Module 18 Challenge.pdf' is the write up of the analysis conducted on the CitiBike data in Tableau Public 

The repository does not contain the csv files downloaded from https://citibikenyc.com/system-data, which I uploaded and transformed in VS Code. Even zipped, they were too large for GitHub.
